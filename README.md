# Reinforcement-Learning

### **Project 1: K-bandits (Multi-Armed Bandit)**  
This program implements reinforcement learning strategies to solve the classic **K-Bandit** problem using approaches such as **ε-greedy** and **UCB**. It compares the effectiveness of these strategies in maximizing accumulated rewards and visualizes average rewards and optimal actions.

### **Project 2: Policy and Value Iteration**  
This program uses the **Policy Iteration** and **Value Iteration** algorithms to solve decision-making problems in dynamic programming. It focuses on the **Gambler’s Problem**, showing how to learn optimal policies to maximize expected rewards. It includes visualizations of value functions and learned policies.

### **Project 3: Monte Carlo, Q-Learning, SARSA, and Expected SARSA**  
This program compares various **reinforcement learning algorithms** (Monte Carlo First Visit, Q-Learning, SARSA, and Expected SARSA) in the **FrozenLake-v1** environment. It evaluates the quality of learned policies, accumulated rewards, and visualizes optimal policies through diagrams in an 8x8 grid environment.
